Acceleration Structure
* Grid
* Octree
* Binary Space Partitioning Tree (BSP Tree)
* KD-Tree
* BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy)


Measure the efficiency of the different acceleration methods
- render time
- total number of rays cast in the scene
- number of times the ray-triangle intersections test has been executed
- number of ray-triangles hits

Mis
- Unified Shader Architecture
- STL C++ atomic library (introduced in C++11)

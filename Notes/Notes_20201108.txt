General Interface

Interact
	Use RayTracer_Sampler and it's child class as example
	
	Available interface
		ObjectHandling
			create
			destroy

		RayTracer_Sampler
			setSizeImage

		RayTracer_Sampler_Grid
			setSizeGrid

	Expected behavior (in Python)
		Gen 1
			interface.execute("Sampler/create", "%i", type_index)
			interface.execute("Sampler/Grid/setSizeGrid", %i%i", w, h)
			- not good on "%i": may be too messy and cost too much time if the function is used in multiple time
			
		Gen 2
			interface.find("Sampler/create")
			func = interface.loadFunction("Sampler/create")
			func(type_index)

			interface.find("Sampler/Grid/setSizeGrid")
			func = interface.loadFunction("Sampler/Grid/setSizeGrid")
			func(w, h)
			- ok for now

	For the current stage
	Should not work on json file first
	Mainly focus on Python
	Should not change C++ code unless it is needed for Python side
